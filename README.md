# Zooplus

First of all, thank you very much for the opportunity and I hope you enjoy the test.

Start the project in ur local environment `npm run serve`

## About time...

The time dedicated to this test was exactly the 6 hours that it said it would take, unfortunately, in these 6 hours I only had time to complete a few small objectives of the test.

Unfortunately, if for every job I am interested in, I have to perform tests that last more than 10 hours, I would not have time to sleep, so the 6 hours marked in the statement, is the time I have proposed to use, no more and no less.

I wish I could dedicate more time to it, but if for every job I am interested in, I have to do tests that last more than 10 hours, plus the 40 hours a week of my current job, I would not have time to sleep, so the 6 hours marked in the test README, is the time I have proposed to use, no more and no less.

I would have loved to continue it and make it perfect, but it seems to me that going over 6 hours wouldn't be reflect my actual work

## Why Angular?

Since I only had 6 hours to do the test, I decided to use the development framework that I am using, since it is the one I currently use in my work.

Also, since I was asked to make a small CRUD to an API, I thought it was a good idea, because the httpClient is a wonderful tool.

## Why didn't you do it in react with the Scaffold we gave you?

In order to develop something minimally viable in react, I would have to update and refresh the contents of the framework which is unfeasible to do in the time frame.

## Where is ur state manager

I love ngrx, but I would have to spend a lot of time reviewing how to do it in angular, whenever I have worked with it, it has been through vue, using vuex as a base.

## Why no unit testing

Normally when I do a service, if I usually develop it following TDD, in case of components I prefer to wait until they are finished. When I was in the middle of the time and seeing that I could not finish, I decided to forget about them, even knowing that they were very short.

## Enrique.... what the hell is that design?

Just basic MVP design with BEM block, easy and simple

## Why do you think I should hire you, if you haven't finished the test?

Despite the fact that there is very little content completed in the test, for me it was a very easy and with the right amount of time I would have completed all the technical debts without any problems, I have done it several times in the past, and I would have completed it without any problems. Maybe I'm not the fastest but I'm not bad at it.

Also working as an architect the last few months and doing only management work, may have taken its effect on me as a developer, who knows?
